# BubbleBeat: The Art of Focus

**BubbleBeat** is a minimalist, browser-based generative art game designed for relaxation and flow-state engagement. Navigate a starlit sky, pop vibrant bubbles, and create a musical journey through a pentatonic soundscape.

---

## ✨ Core Experience
The game is built around two distinct ways to play, catering to different moods:

* **Continuous Flow**: A pure "zen" mode. No scores, no pressure—just endless bubbles and generative music.
* **Sky Challenge**: A gamified experience where you must maintain your "Focus Meter." Reaching peak focus (100% health) rewards you with a radiant, glowing trail.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1.  **Move to Create**: Your cursor or finger creates a fluid trail across the screen.
2.  **Pop to Play**: Hover over bubbles to pop them. Each pop triggers a note from a pentatonic scale, ensuring every interaction is harmonious.
3.  **Find Your Rhythm**: 
    * In **Sky Challenge**, missing bubbles reduces your health.
    * Pop **4 bubbles in a row** to trigger a "Combo Streak," making your trail thicker.
    * **Peak State**: Reach **100% Health** to activate a vibrant neon glow on your trail.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
* **Generative Sound**: Uses the **Web Audio API** to synthesize real-time pentatonic notes based on the vertical position of the bubbles.
* **Dynamic Visuals**: 
    * Layered parallax backgrounds with moving nebulae and twinkling stars.
    * Canvas-based particle systems for bubble pops.
    * Cubic-bezier trail smoothing for organic movement.
* **Performance Optimized**: Utilizes `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps rendering.
* **Mobile Ready**: Fully responsive touch-action support for iOS and Android.
